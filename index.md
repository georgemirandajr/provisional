# Volume and Discrepancies Over Time

# As we get more ballots, the number of discrepancies increases

<img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-3.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

* The only occasions when we had zero discrepancies were times when we received under 2,000 provisionals.

# Work Cell Pilot

![](X:/Ballot Accountability/work cell/Workcell2.jpg)

---

# Work Cell Design

* Signature verification, open envelopes, enhance/remake ballots, process write-ins, and send to tally 
* 10% of staff participated in the pilot 
* 2 trays delivered to the work cell per day
* The work cell only counted ballots 2 times: entrance and exit.

---

# Today's Accountability

* Work Cell volume: 17,600 (15%)  
* Work Cell discrepancies: 0 

* Normal Process volume: 104,000 (85%)  
* Normal Process discrepancies: 128

* November 2010 Gubernatorial Election (last comparable election)
* If we had 15% of that volume, we would have had 725 discrepancies 


| &nbsp;  |  Election  |  Volume  |  Diff  |
|:-------:|:----------:|:--------:|:------:|
|  **4**  | 11/2/2010  | 175,697  | 4,836  |

# Productivity Ratios

---

# Benefits/Observations

* Eliminated 50 hours of counting (15 min per tray * 200 trays) each time we count
* Faster training because supervisor has time now
* Enabled cross-training of Canvass operations
* Write-ins - being in the same room eliminates a count
* Ballot Duplication - faster communication without handoffs

---

# Recommendations

* Don't slow the flow to work cell
* Single-piece flow all the way (Signature Verification through Canvass)
* Ergonomics
* Add one additional ballot duplication PC and scanner 
* Hybrid for large elections (UDEL)
